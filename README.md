# My N8N Projects

This repository contains my personal **n8n workflow collection**, where I experiment, automate, and learn automation development using [n8n](https://n8n.io/).  
Each folder contains a workflow JSON file that can be directly imported into your self-hosted or cloud n8n instance.

## Projects Overview

### 1) First N8n Workflow

A simple AI-powered workflow integrating **Google Gemini Chat Model** with **LangChain Agent**, **memory buffer**, and a **calculator tool**.  
This was my first experiment with n8nâ€™s AI Agent framework to test conversational memory and tool usage.

**Highlights:**

- Uses **Google Gemini (PaLM)** for chat-based AI responses.
- Includes **memory persistence** and **calculation capabilities**.
- Serves as a base template for future AI workflows.

### 2) Calendar Planner Agent

An intelligent calendar assistant built with **LangChain Agent + Google Calendar** integration.  
It can find available time slots and create events automatically via AI conversation.

**Highlights:**

- Uses **Google Calendar API** (OAuth2).
- AI agent determines and schedules events dynamically.
- Built-in memory for contextual conversation flow.
